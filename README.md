### **Repository Description:**
> **CASolution.ArchitectureTests**  
> This repository contains automated architecture tests for projects following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The tests ensure that the architectural boundaries and rules are consistently enforced across the solution. By validating dependencies, layers, and cross-cutting concerns, these tests help maintain architectural integrity and scalability over time.

# CASolution.ArchitectureTests

This repository provides a suite of automated tests to ensure the **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles are adhered to across all layers of the CASolution. These architecture tests enforce consistency, maintainability, and correct separation of concerns within the solution.

## Why Use Architecture Tests?

Architecture tests are essential for large projects or solutions that follow architectural patterns like **Clean Architecture** and **DDD**. These tests ensure that:
- **Layered dependencies** are respected (e.g., UI layer doesn’t reference the data layer directly).
- **Domain rules** are enforced, ensuring proper communication between domain and application layers.
- **Cross-cutting concerns** are properly isolated.
- **Best practices** are followed, reducing the risk of technical debt.

By automating these checks, the project remains clean, maintainable, and scalable as it evolves.

## Key Features

- **Enforce Layered Architecture**: Ensures that dependencies between layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation) are respected.
- **Validate Domain Rules**: Ensures proper interaction between domain entities, services, and repositories.
- **Test Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Ensures that logging, exception handling, and other cross-cutting concerns are implemented correctly without violating layer dependencies.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Can be easily integrated into your continuous integration pipeline to prevent architecture rule violations during development.

### Tests Breakdown
- **LayerTests.cs**: Validates that each layer of the application (Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure) follows Clean Architecture principles.
- **DependencyTests.cs**: Ensures that no inappropriate dependencies are being injected into restricted layers.
- **DomainRulesTests.cs**: Validates domain logic and ensures proper interactions between aggregates, entities, and repositories.
- **CrossCuttingTests.cs**: Tests for proper implementation of cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, and exception handling.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CASolution.ArchitectureTests.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that testing libraries like `xUnit` or `NUnit` are installed.
   - You might also want to use architecture testing libraries such as [ArchUnitNET](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnitNET) for .NET projects.

3. **Run the Tests**:
   - Run the tests using your preferred test runner (e.g., Visual Studio Test Explorer or command line).
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Example Test: Layer Dependency Enforcement

```csharp
[Fact]
public void DomainLayer_Should_Not_Depend_On_ApplicationLayer()
{
    var result = ArchitectureTestUtils.CheckLayerDependencies(
        "CASolution.Domain", 
        "CASolution.Application"
    );
    Assert.False(result, "Domain layer should not depend on Application layer.");
}
```
